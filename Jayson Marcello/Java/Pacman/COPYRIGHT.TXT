Copyright is a legal concept that grants exclusive rights to the creator of an original work. This can include literary, artistic, musical, and other creative works. The holder of a copyright has the sole right to reproduce, distribute, and adapt the work, as well as to authorize others to do so. Copyright protection begins as soon as the work is created and fixed in a tangible form, such as writing, recording, or drawing. While registration is not required for copyright protection, it provides additional legal benefits and protections. Copyright ensures that creators have control over how their works are used and allows them to benefit financially from their creativity. Violating copyright law by using a protected work without permission can result in legal consequences. Overall, copyright serves to encourage creativity and innovation by safeguarding the rights of creators.
